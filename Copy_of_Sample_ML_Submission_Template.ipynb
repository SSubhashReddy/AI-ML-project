        "The Glassdoor Review Analysis project focuses on extracting actionable insights from employee reviews and salary data available on Glassdoor to support both job seekers and employers in making informed decisions. The platform contains a wealth of user-generated content including reviews, ratings, company culture feedback, interview experiences, and compensation information across various roles and industries.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core objective of this project is to perform end-to-end data analysis to understand employee sentiment, identify key satisfaction drivers, analyze salary trends, and predict employee ratings using machine learning models. Data was scraped or sourced from Glassdoor (or similar datasets) containing information such as job titles, company names, locations, pros and cons of working at the company, employee ratings, and salary figures.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first phase of the project involved data cleaning and preprocessing, which included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting textual reviews into a structured format using NLP techniques. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to discover patterns in employee satisfaction, salary distribution across roles, company performance, and geographic differences in pay and reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "Text analytics and sentiment analysis were applied to employee reviews using techniques such as TF-IDF, word clouds, and sentiment scoring via VADER and TextBlob. This helped in categorizing common themes in the pros and cons sections and correlating sentiment scores with overall ratings. Additionally, machine learning models like linear regression, decision trees, and random forests were employed to predict employee ratings based on review text, job role, and location.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key insights from the project revealed that job satisfaction is strongly influenced by work-life balance, management quality, and career development opportunities. It was also found that companies with strong positive review sentiment tended to have higher overall ratings and employee retention. Furthermore, the salary analysis showed significant variance across industries and cities, highlighting the importance of location and job title in compensation.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates the power of combining unstructured text data with structured company and salary information to derive meaningful business and career insights. The findings can help HR teams improve workplace culture and help job seekers make better employment decisions based on honest feedback from current and former employees."
